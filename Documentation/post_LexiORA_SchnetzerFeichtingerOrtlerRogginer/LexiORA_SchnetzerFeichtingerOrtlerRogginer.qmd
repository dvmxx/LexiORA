# LexiORA - Object Recognition Assistand for Language Learning

## Overview

LexiORA is an augmented reality-based language learning application designed to help international students learn German vocabulary through real-world object recognition.
The app allows users to point their smartphone camera at everyday objects and instantly receive the German word, pronunciation, article, definition, and usage examples.
Built as a progressive web application with real-time object detection, LexiORA combines mobile-first design, computer vision, and an engaging mascot experience to
create an intuitive learning tool that transforms any environment into a German language classroom.

## Objectives

### Primary Goals:

- Create an accessible mobile web application for vocabulary acquisition that requires no app store installation
- Implement real-time object detection to identify everyday objects and provide German translations
- Design an engaging, mascot-driven user experience with "Lexi" as the friendly robot guide
- Enable persistent learning through a personal collection feature for reviewed vocabulary

### Key Constraints:

- Development timeline: 8 weeks (November 2025 - January 2026)
- Team size: 4 members
- Target platform: Mobile web browsers with camera access (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Technology requirement: Must work without backend database (local storage only)
- Hardware constraint: Client-side inference suitable for mobile devices

## Approach & Architecture

### System Architecture

LexiORA follows a hybrid client-server architecture optimized for mobile deployment:

![System Architecture Diagram](assets/lexiora-system-architecture.png)

*LexiORA's hybrid architecture with client-side ML inference and Flask backend for static file serving*

### Key Design Decisions
1. Progressive Web App (PWA) Architecture

Rationale: Eliminates app store deployment friction, allows instant access via URL
Implementation: Responsive design with viewport adaptation, mobile-first CSS
Trade-off: Requires HTTPS (self-signed certificate for development)

2. Hybrid ML Approach

Client-side (Primary): COCO-SSD via TensorFlow.js for low latency
Server-side (Backup): TFLite model with Flask endpoint for offline capability
Rationale: Client-side inference provides real-time feedback (~500ms detection cycle), server maintains model flexibility

3. Camera-Centric UI with AR Frame

Design Pattern: Full-screen camera view with centered AR target frame
Detection Logic: Prioritizes objects closest to frame center
User Feedback: Live confidence scores and floating labels on detected objects

4. Local-First Data Strategy

Storage: SessionStorage for temporary captures, LocalStorage for persistent collections
Dictionary: Embedded JavaScript object with 80+ COCO labels mapped to German
Trade-off: No cloud sync, but maintains privacy and works offline

5. Mascot-Driven Onboarding

Character: "Lexi" - friendly robot assistant with 8 emotional states
Purpose: Reduces intimidation factor, guides users through permissions
States: curious, idea, learning, profile, reading, scanning, show, teaching

## Implementation

### Technology Stack
**Frontend**:

- HTML5 (Semantic markup, accessibility attributes)
- CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid, CSS Variables for theming, media queries)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+, no framework dependencies)
- MediaDevices API (getUserMedia for camera access)
- Canvas API (Image capture and manipulation)

**Backend**:

- Python 3.10+
- Flask 2.3 (Lightweight web server)
- OpenSSL (Self-signed certificate generation)

**Machine Learning**:

- TensorFlow.js (COCO-SSD model for browser-based inference)
- TensorFlow Lite (SSD MobileNet V2 model for server-side detection)
- NumPy, PIL, OpenCV (Image preprocessing)

**Development Tools**:

- Git (Version control)
- Chrome DevTools (Mobile device emulation)
- intelliJ

### Data Sources and Preprocessing
**Object Detection Model**:

- **Source:** Pre-trained COCO-SSD (80 object classes from COCO dataset)
- **Preprocessing:**
    - Video frames captured at 1280x720 resolution
    - Resized to 416x416 for TFLite model input
    - Normalized to uint8 RGB format
    - No data augmentation (real-time inference)

**German Dictionary:**

- Source: Manual compilation of 80+ translations
- Structure: JSON-like object with:
    - german: Translation
    - article: der/die/das (grammatical gender)
    - pronunciation: IPA notation
    - definition: Short German explanation
    - example: Context sentence

Example Entry:

```javascript
"laptop": {
  german: "Laptop",
  article: "der",
  pronunciation: "/ˈlɛptɔp/",
  definition: "Tragbarer Computer",
  example: "Ich arbeite an meinem Laptop."
}
```

### Deployment and Runtime
**Development Environment:**

1. Local HTTPS server: python https_server.py
2. Server listens on https://0.0.0.0:8000
3. Access via mobile browser: https://<LOCAL_IP>:8000/LexiORA/templates/welcome-screen.html

**Network Requirements:**

- Same WiFi network for development (or mobile hotspot)
- SSL certificate acceptance (self-signed warning)
- Camera permissions granted in browser

**Browser Compatibility:**

- iOS Safari 14+
- Android Chrome 90+
- Desktop Chrome/Edge (development testing)
- Firefox (requires getUserMedia polyfill)

**Code Quality Practices**

- Modular Structure: Separation of concerns (camera logic, storage, navigation)
- Error Handling: Try-catch blocks for camera access, model loading
- User Feedback: Loading indicators, permission prompts, success banners
- Responsive Design: Dynamic viewport height calculation for mobile browsers
- Accessibility: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels for screen readers (future enhancement)

## Results & Evaluation

### Success Metrics
**Technical Performance:**

- Object detection latency: ~500ms per frame (client-side COCO-SSD)
- Detection confidence threshold: 60% (balances precision/recall)
- Camera stream resolution: 1280x720 (optimal for mobile)
- Model accuracy: 80+ object classes with reliable indoor/outdoor detection
- Page load time: <2 seconds on 4G connection

**User Experience:**

- Zero-installation access via URL (PWA benefit)
- Intuitive 3-step flow: Scan → Learn → Save
- Persistent vocabulary collection with visual thumbnails
- Mascot engagement (Lexi appears in 6 screens with contextual expressions)

**Educational Value:**

- Immediate feedback loop (real-world object → German word in <1 second)
- Comprehensive word information (article, pronunciation, example)
- Contextual learning through actual environment

### What Worked Well

- Real-time Detection UX: The live camera feed with floating labels provides instant gratification and maintains user engagement
- Mascot Integration: Lexi's friendly presence significantly reduces app intimidation factor (observed in informal user testing)
- Local Storage Strategy: No backend complexity allows fast development and maintains user privacy
- Hybrid ML Approach: Client-side inference provides low latency while server-side backup ensures flexibility
- Mobile-First Design: Viewport height calculations and touch-optimized UI work seamlessly across devices

### Limitations and Shortcomings

1. Object Coverage: COCO-SSD limited to 80 classes - misses many common items (e.g., pen, paper, door)
    - Impact: Users may point at objects that aren't recognized
    - Workaround: Clear messaging about supported objects

2. Dictionary Completeness: Not all COCO classes have German translations
    - Current Status: 80+ entries manually curated
    - Missing: Some animals and specialized objects

3. No Custom Model Training: Using pre-trained COCO-SSD prevents domain-specific optimization
    - Impact: Cannot add custom vocabulary categories (e.g., office supplies, classroom items)

4. Network Dependency: Requires local server for development
    - Impact: Not truly standalone for end-users
    - Solution Needed: Deploy to public HTTPS server or convert to full PWA with service workers

5. Browser Compatibility: getUserMedia API requires HTTPS and recent browser versions
    - Impact: Older devices may not support the app
    - Partial Solution: Graceful degradation with clear error messages

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

**Key Technical Challenges:**

- HTTPS Camera Access: Modern browsers require SSL certificates for getUserMedia API - solved with self-signed certificates for development
- Mobile Viewport Issues: iOS Safari's dynamic toolbar required custom JavaScript viewport height calculations
- Model Output Parsing: TFLite model's unconventional 3-tensor output structure needed experimental analysis to decode correctly
- Real-time Performance: Reduced detection frequency to 500ms intervals to prevent lag on lower-end mobile devices
- Permission UX: Dedicated permission screen with Lexi mascot significantly reduced user friction and rejection rates

**Design Learnings:**

- Mobile UI requires ruthless information prioritization - card-based layouts with clear hierarchy work best
- Hybrid approach (AR frame + full-screen detection) balances user guidance with transparency
- LocalStorage is viable for educational apps without backend complexity

**Process Insights:**

- Early user testing revealed need for immediate vocabulary value over pure mascot engagement
- Pivoting from custom model training to pre-trained COCO-SSD kept project on timeline
- Mobile-first development is essential - desktop testing misses critical mobile-specific issues
- German dictionary curation took 40% of development time but provides core educational value

**What We'd Do Differently:**
Use a component framework (React/Vue) instead of vanilla JavaScript, deploy to cloud earlier for real-device testing,
implement backend storage for multi-device sync, add Web Speech API for audio pronunciation, and conduct formal user
research with FHV's language school

## Future Work

- Service Worker integration for offline functionality and daily practice reminders
- Web Speech API for audio pronunciation of German words
- Expanded dictionary to 200+ objects including plural forms and regional dialects
- Spaced repetition flashcard system for collection review
- UI polish with haptic feedback and swipe gestures
- Custom training for domain-specific objects (classroom, office, household items)
- Multi-language support (French, Spanish, Italian)
- Social features: collection sharing, collaborative challenges, leaderboards
